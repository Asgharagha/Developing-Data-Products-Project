The following prediction algorithm is created to predict the amount of electricity in kilowatt-hours (KWH) consumed in a house with respect to the number of hours that the air conditioner (AC) is used per day. My goal is to create a web site so that users can input the number of hours that an air conditioner is turned on and obtain an estimate of the amount of electricity consumption per day.

KWH = 5.34*AC + 27.85
